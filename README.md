# Overview
This project is a React application designed to showcase various React concepts including components, JSX, props, and state management. I made this application as a way to apply basic React concepts.

 ## **React Concepts Covered**

### **Components** 
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They encapsulate logic and UI, allowing for code reuse and modularization. In this project, you'll find various components such as CoreConcepts, TabButton, and Header, each serving a specific purpose.

### **JSX** 
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for writing HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX makes it easier to create React elements and compose UI components. Throughout the project, JSX is used extensively to define the UI structure within React components.

### **Props** 
Props (short for properties) are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only and help make components reusable and customizable. In this project, props are utilized to pass data and configuration to child components, allowing for greater flexibility and abstraction.

### **State** 
State represents the mutable data within a React component. It enables components to manage and respond to changes in data over time. State can be updated using the setState method, triggering re-renders of the component. In this project, state is used to manage dynamic data and component behavior.
